A clean and powerful console-based quiz Game written in C.  
Built to strengthen core programming concepts — loops, conditions, and logic — without any shortcuts or premature complexity.
---
## Features⚙️

- Start quiz with 5 questions(as of now)
- Score calculation (+20 / -0)
- Final rank display based on performance
- Menu-based interface(loop based)
- No pointers or advance programming fog — just real logic

##  Tech Stack🚀🚀

- C programming language 
- Console-based UI
- Logical programming
- Modular programming
- Interface- **CLI**


##  Concepts Practiced🪛

- if-else, switch-case
- Loops (for/while)
- Functions(user-defined)
- Arrays (1D,2D and 3D)

- Use of linkers

## Future Upgrades🛰️

- Struct-based question handling
- Load questions from external file(more than 10 questions)
- High score system using file I/O
- Timer using `time.h`
- CLI animation (ncurses or ASCII effects)
- GUI version using SDL or similar stuff.

## How to Run🔛
Compile the file using any C compiler:

bash(command line)
```
