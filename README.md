# QUIZZER RUSH - C Console Interface🎯
A clean and powerful console-based quiz Game written in C.  
Built to strengthen core programming concepts — loops, conditions, and logic — without any shortcuts or premature complexity.

## Features⚙️
- Start quiz with 5 questions(as of now)
- Score calculation (+20 / -0)
- Final rank display based on performance
- Menu-based interface(loop based)
- No pointers or advance programming fog — just real logic

##  Tech Stack🚀🚀
- C programming language 
- Console-based UI
- Logical programming
- Modular programming
- Interface- **CLI**

##  Concepts Practiced🪛
- if-else, switch-case
- Loops (for/while)
- Functions(user-defined)
- Arrays (1D,2D and 3D)
- Modular code structure
- Use of linkers

## Future Upgrades🛰️
- Struct-based question handling
- Load questions from external file(more than 10 questions)
- High score system using file I/O
- Timer using `time.h`
- CLI animation (ncurses or ASCII effects)
- GUI version using SDL or similar stuff.

## How it works ?
1. Start the application in the terminal.
2. The questions will be displayed with the options.
3. User has to choose the right option and enter it on the command-line.
4. Instant result stating whether the answer is correct or not is depicted.
5. Each right answer is assigned a score of **20** and each wrong answer is assigned a score of **0**.
6. The **total score** is calculated and displayed after all questions are answered.
7. A **rank** is also assigned to the user based on total score.
8. (**Note**: The user can take the quiz multiple times as needed.)

## How to Run🔛
1) Clone the repo.
1) Compile and run the file using any C compiler in the terminal:
```cmd
     gcc quiz.c -o quiz && quiz #for windows
```
2) The application will be open for user interaction in the terminal.

#### Note:*For clear screen in the output,append the code with*
```c 
system("cls");   //for WINDOWS OS
system("clear");   //for MAC/LINUX OS  
```
